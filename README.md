# DH Field Kit

This workshop will introduce you to a few foundational tools that tend to get used again and again in DH work but that don't always get talked about. These are the command line, Git, and text editors. In many cases, knowledge of these tools is already assumed as a prerequisite for following a tutorial or learning another tool.

In this session, we will:

- Learn what the UNIX command line is and what it's for
- Learn about how our computer's file system is organized.
- Learn how to orient ourselves in the command line
- Learn how to navigate files and folders in the command line
- Learn about text files and their properties
- Learn how to open and edit files using a text editor
- Learn about version control and why we should use it
- Place a folder under version control
- "Push" work from our local machine to GitHub
