# Creating a cheat sheet

In this section, we'll create a text file that we can use as a cheat sheet. You can use it to keep track of all the awesome commands you're learning. 


## Using a text editor

We'll now use a text editor to add some of the commands that we've learned to a cheat sheet. Text editors are programs that allow you to edit plain text files, such as .txt, .py (Python scripts), and .csv (spreadsheet files). Remember not to use programs such as Microsoft Word to edit text files, since they add invisible characters that can cause problems. 

Use the `code` command to open your Visual Studio Code text editor with a new file:

	code cheat-sheet.txt

Go ahead and type the commands we've learned so far in the file. Include descriptions about what each command does. Remember -- this cheat sheet is for you. Write descriptions that make sense to you or take notes about questions.

Save the file.

Once you're done, check the contents of the file on the command line with the `cat` command:

```
$ cat cheat-sheet.txt
My Institute Cheat Sheet

ls
lists files and folders in a directory

cd ~
change directory to home folder

...
```

The `cat` command prints out the contents of a file.
